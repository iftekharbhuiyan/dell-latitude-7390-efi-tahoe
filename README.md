## Important Note

Please pay attention to the following issues before and after you perform installation process.

<details>
<summary><strong>Right Disk Drive</strong></summary>
Hackintosh works well with Samsung and Western Digital based SSD drives and that is entirely my personal opinion based on my experiences. Try to stay away from less popular branded drives. This computer supports both the SATA and NVMe based drives, so pick a drive wisely.

<summary><strong>Audio Issue</strong></summary>
Correct audio `layout-id` is crucially important for your build here, so spent sometime to figure it out. Check the AppleALC [supported codec](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs) page which covers wide range of audio devices.
