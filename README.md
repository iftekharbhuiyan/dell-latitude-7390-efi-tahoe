## Important Note

Please pay attention to the following issues before and after you perform installation process.

<details>
<summary><strong>Right Disk Drive</strong></summary>
<br/>
Hackintosh works well with Samsung and Western Digital based SSD drives and that is entirely my personal opinion based on my experiences. Try to stay away from less popular branded drives. This computer supports both the SATA and NVMe based drives, so pick a drive wisely.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Audio Issue</strong></summary>
<br/>
Correct audio <code>layout-id</code> is crucially important for your build here, so spent sometime to figure it out. Check the AppleALC <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs" target="_blank">supported codec</a> page which covers wide range of audio devices. Bare in mind that <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC" target="_blank">AppleALC</a> does not work on macOS 26 aka Tahoe. So, read the page carefully. I opted for <code>VoodooHDA</code> and included the kext file withing the <code>EFI</code>. If that does not help, try with VoodooHDA <a href="https://olarila.com/topic/42836-easy-audio-solution-on-hackintosh-on-macos-tahoe/" target="_blank">compiler</a> which should work.

<details>
<summary><strong>USB Mapping</strong></summary>
<br/>
The EFI already includes USB mapped kext file of my device. This may or may not work for you. So, use the <a href="https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool" target="_blank">USB Tool Box</a> and generate your own USB mapped kext file in case if mine does not work.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Generate SMBIOS</strong></summary>
<br/>
Please generate your own SMBIOS with <a href="https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools" target="_blank">OC Auxiliary Tools</a> or any other tool that you are familiar with.
